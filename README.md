# Timeshift
University of Mississippi ACM 2019 Game Jam winner. This game was created in 48 hours using the prompt "there is no time". The player has one minute to collect as many yellow cubes as possible. The player has to dodge enemies that reduce the player's score. The player can speed up and slow down time, and must collect time cubes to fuel the ability. Players can slow down time to dodge projectiles, and speed up time to increase the number of points collected with each cube. The game has a retrowave/outrune aesthetic with music by Akira. Time Shift was developed using the Unity game engine.
